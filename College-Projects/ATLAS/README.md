The project was initiated to solve the growing problem of traffic light violation, the massive traffic jams. Also, some motivation was from, everyday growing news headlines regarding road rage, accidents (Danger to life).  We have used openALPR for scanning of vehicles number plates, and raspberry pi (laptop also) for detecting those vehicles who crossroads during red lights and then it recognizes its vehicles number then mail it to our database (email). It took a lot of research and readings about the number plates and training openALPR according to Indian number plates.
